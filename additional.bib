  abstract  = {Improving the performance of on-chip caches has been continually regarded with much effort to provide solution to the increased performance gap between microprocessor and memory. Proposed new design techniques were mostly implemented in software simply because it is easier and faster than hardware implementation. However, with the microprocessor technology advancement, this approach fails to consider other crucial matters such as power and area. To investigate and further evaluate the dynamic partitioning schemes in a shared L2 cache in Chip Multiprocessors (CMP), we have come up with a model to bring together generated traces from the M5 simulator and the hardware implementation of a shared L2 cache described using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) and developed using the Synopsys EDA tools. The use of this system model offers a number of benefits such as the following: (1) L2 cache designs can now be characterized using power and area measurements and not just performance gain alone, (2) processor and L1 caches can be abstracted away from the design to provide more focus, (3) standard benchmark can still be used to evaluate the different designs being compared, and (4) a more realistic design that is closer to getting materialized can be produced.},

  abstract   = {The gem5 simulation infrastructure is the merger of the best aspects of the M5 [4] and GEMS [9] simulators. M5 provides a highly configurable simulation framework, multiple ISAs, and diverse CPU models. GEMS complements these features with a detailed and exible memory system, including support for multiple cache coherence protocols and interconnect models. Currently, gem5 supports most commercial ISAs (ARM, ALPHA, MIPS, Power, SPARC, and x86), including booting Linux on three of them (ARM, ALPHA, and x86).The project is the result of the combined efforts of many academic and industrial institutions, including AMD, ARM, HP, MIPS, Princeton, MIT, and the Universities of Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin. Over the past ten years, M5 and GEMS have been used in hundreds of publications and have been downloaded tens of thousands of times. The high level of collaboration on the gem5 project, combined with the previous success of the component parts and a liberal BSD-like license, make gem5 a valuable full-system simulation tool.},
