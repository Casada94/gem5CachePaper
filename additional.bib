abstract = {This document describes release 2.0 of the SimpleScalar tool set, a suite of free, publicly available simulation tools that offer both detailed and high-performance simulation of modern microprocessors. The new release offers more tools and capabilities, precompiled binaries, cleaner interfaces, better documentation, easier installation, improved portability, and higher performance. This paper contains a complete description of the tool set, including retrieval and installation instructions, a description of how to use the tools, a description of the target SimpleScalar architecture, and many details about the internals of the tools and how to customize them. With this guide, the tool set can be brought up and generating results in under an hour (on supported platforms).},
