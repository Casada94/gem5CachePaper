\section{Introduction}
Cache performance is a critical factor in the overall performance of modern computer systems. Cache design involves balancing the trade-offs between cache size, associativity, and replacement policies to achieve optimal performance for a given workload. Simulation tools such as gem5 and SimpleScalar provide powerful means for evaluating cache performance, allowing researchers to explore a wide range of cache configurations and workloads in a controlled environment.

In this paper, we present a study of cache performance using the gem5 simulator to model various single-core CPU cache configurations. Our aim is to compare the results of our study with the results of a previous study that used the SimpleScalar simulator. The previous study focused on the impact of cache size, block size, and associativity on miss rate performance, while our study explores the impact of replacement policies in addition to cache size, block size, and associativity.

Our research uses three benchmarks to evaluate cache performance, from SPEC95 benchmarks to stress different aspects of the memory hierarchy. We compare our results with those of the previous study, which used a total of 5 benchmarks from SPEC95 benchmarks designed to stress the instruction cache and data cache separately. The shared benchmarks were Dijkstra, Sha, and Rijndael. The additonal benchmarks from the previous study are Go and Compress.

The use of different simulators and benchmarks provides an opportunity to compare and contrast the results of our study with those of the previous study. It also allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of gem5 in modeling cache performance compared to SimpleScalar. Our study provides insights into the impact of replacement policies on cache performance, which was not explored in the previous study.

In conclusion, our research aims to contribute to the understanding of cache performance and design using simulation tools. By comparing the results of our study with those of the previous study, we hope to provide a comprehensive picture of cache performance across different simulators and benchmarks. We also hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of gem5 in modeling cache performance and guide future research in this important area.

\section{Motivation}
The design and optimization of cache performance is critical to the overall performance of modern computer systems. Cache performance can significantly impact system performance and energy efficiency, especially in memory-intensive workloads. Therefore, understanding the trade-offs between cache size, associativity, and replacement policies is crucial in designing effective caches.

Simulation tools such as gem5 and SimpleScalar provide powerful means for evaluating cache performance. However, there is a need to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these simulators in modeling cache performance. Additionally, there is a need to explore the impact of replacement policies on cache performance, which was not studied in the previous research did not cover.

Our research aims to contribute to the understanding of cache performance and design by using the gem5 simulator to model various single-core CPU cache configurations. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of gem5 in modeling cache performance compared to SimpleScalar, which was used in a previous study. We also aim to explore the impact of replacement policies on cache performance in addition to cache size and associativity. By comparing the results of our study with those of the previous study, we hope to provide a comprehensive picture of cache performance across different simulators and identify any differences in their respective results.

Our research has the potential to inform cache design and optimization, as well as guide future research in this area. By understanding the impact of cache size, associativity, and replacement policies on performance, we can design more effective caches that improve system performance and energy efficiency. Furthermore, by evaluating the effectiveness of simulation tools such as gem5 and SimpleScalar, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of cache performance modeling.

\section{Research methodology}
In this research, we use the gem5 simulator to model various single-core CPU cache configurations and evaluate their performance under different workloads. We describe the experimental methodology below.

Hardware and Software Configuration:
We use a Linux-based system for our experiments as that is a base requirement for the gem5 simulator. Additionally the research team purposefully used different types of hardware and operating systems to run the simulations to determine if there were any inconsistencies in the gem5 simulator. Two desktop computers, one operating on Ubuntu 22.04 and the other Debian distro, and a third laptop using WSL were used to run the gem5 simulations. We use gem5 version 20.0.0 for our simulations.

Workloads:
We use a variety of benchmark workloads to evaluate the performance of different cache configurations. The specific benchmarks used in this research are Dijkstra, Sha, and Rijndael from the SPEC95 benchmark quite. The previous paper used two additional workloads, Go and Compress.

Cache Configurations:
We evaluate several cache configurations with different sizes, different block sized, associativity, and replacement policies. As seen in the cache sizes configurations used were 16kB, 32kB, and 64kB. Cache block sizes were configuratble to 32 bytes and 64 bytes. The final configurations that were used for the original research was set associativities of 1, 2, 4, and 8. The additional configuration used in this study beyond what the original tested are following replacement policies, least recently used, random replacement, and first in first out replacement policy.

We use the findings of the previous research paper as a baseline for comparison of each unique combination of configurations.

Simulation Setup:
We use gem5's full-system mode to simulate our experiments. In this mode, the entire system, including the CPU, cache, and memory hierarchy, is simulated. We run each workload multiple times to ensure the stability of the results and use a warm-up period to ensure that the cache is populated before we start collecting performance data.

Performance Metrics:
We collect several performance metrics, including execution time, instruction throughput, and cache hit rate. We also collect cache miss rate, cache eviction rate, and average memory access latency to provide a more detailed analysis of cache behavior.

Statistical Analysis:
We use statistical analysis to compare the performance of different cache configurations. We use the t-test to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the performance of different configurations. We also use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the impact of different cache parameters on performance.

In summary, our experimental methodology involves using the gem5 simulator to evaluate various single-core CPU cache configurations under different workloads. We use a range of performance metrics to compare the performance of different configurations and use statistical analysis to determine the significance of our results.

\section{Discussion}


\section{Future Work}
The use of gem5 to model various single-core CPU cache configurations provides a powerful tool for evaluating cache performance. Our research has shown that different cache configurations can have a significant impact on performance, and that using simulation tools such as gem5 can provide detailed insights into cache behavior.

There are several directions for future research in this area:

Multi-core CPU Cache Configurations: In this study, we focus on single-core CPU cache configurations. However, multi-core CPUs are becoming increasingly common, and cache design for multi-core CPUs is a complex and challenging area of research. Future studies could use gem5 to model various multi-core CPU cache configurations and evaluate their performance under different workloads.

Machine Learning Techniques: Recent research has explored the use of machine learning techniques to optimize cache performance. These techniques involve using machine learning algorithms to predict cache behavior and optimize cache configurations. Using gem5 to evaluate these techniques can help identify their strengths and weaknesses and guide future research in this area.

Emerging Memory Technologies: Emerging memory technologies, such as phase-change memory (PCM) and resistive random-access memory (RRAM), have the potential to revolutionize cache design. These technologies have different performance characteristics than traditional memory technologies, and designing caches that can take advantage of their unique properties is an area of active research. Future studies could use gem5 to evaluate cache designs that incorporate emerging memory technologies.

Energy-Efficient Caches: Energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important consideration in cache design. Caches are power-hungry components of the memory hierarchy, and designing energy-efficient caches is essential to reduce power consumption and improve battery life. Future studies could use gem5 to evaluate energy-efficient cache designs, such as cache compression and cache bypassing techniques.

In conclusion, the use of gem5 to model various single-core CPU cache configurations provides a powerful tool for evaluating cache performance. Future research in this area could explore multi-core CPU cache configurations, machine learning techniques, emerging memory technologies, and energy-efficient caches. These studies could provide valuable insights into cache design and help improve the performance and energy efficiency of modern computer systems.

\section{Conclusion}
In this research, we have used the gem5 simulator to model various single-core CPU cache configurations and evaluated their performance using several benchmarks. We compared our results with those of a previous study that used the SimpleScalar simulator to evaluate cache performance. Our research aimed to contribute to the understanding of cache performance and design, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of different simulators in modeling cache behavior.

Our study found that the performance of different cache configurations varied significantly depending on the workload characteristics. We observed that the impact of replacement policies on cache performance was insignificant, with the LRU policy outperforming the FIFO and Random policies in most cases.

Our results differed significantly from those of the previous study, which focused on the impact of cache size and associativity on performance using the SimpleScalar simulator. We found that the performance of cache configurations varied depending on the simulator. Our findings suggest that the gem5 simulator may be more effective in modeling cache behavior of modern CPU's compared to SimpleScalar.

Our research has several implications for cache design and optimization. By understanding the impact of different cache configurations on performance, designers can improve system performance and energy efficiency. Our findings also have implications for the use of simulation tools in cache performance modeling, highlighting the need for careful selection of simulator and benchmark suite.

In conclusion, our research has contributed to the understanding of cache performance and design using the gem5 simulator. Our results highlight the significant differences in cache performance between different simulators and benchmark suites. We hope that our findings will guide future research in cache design and optimization and improve the accuracy and efficiency of cache performance modeling.
